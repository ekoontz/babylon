A Clojure library for generation and parsing of natural language expressions.

Based on a linguistic theory called HPSG (Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar). More about HPSG:

Generation:
===

= transitive sentences =

Eyes see governments.
We see families.
Points see things.
Words see me.
Days see systems.
Weeks see me.
Homes see programs.
Questions see hands.
Lots see mothers.
Books see systems.

= reflexive sentences =

He sees himself.
He sees himself.
Problems see themselves.
Antonio sees himself.
I see myself.
It sees itself.
It sees itself.
Antonio sees himself.
I see myself.
I see myself.

= 'long' sentences =

The bad businesses let a thing dogs turn.
The places that puppies move use a puppy studies make.
The things women let give the certain names.
A world that Antonio gets means a question lots need.
The works that hands give let a state that waters help.
The major businesses play the cases that we get.
The students that companies run turn a problem that eyes find.
The points that companies began make the night governments get.
The true lots begin the men that began.
A book that says lets the facts that days want.

Parsing:
===

[np  .a *program]
[s  .rooms *take], [s-slash  .rooms *take]
[np  .the *water]
[s  .waters *work], [s-slash  .waters *work]
[s  .you *became], [s-slash  .you *became]
[np  .a *system]
[np  .the *parts]
[s  .points *go]
[np  .a *mother]
[np  .the *things]
