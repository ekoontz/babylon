A Clojure library for generation and parsing of natural language expressions.

Based on a linguistic theory called HPSG (Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar). More about HPSG:

REPL-y 0.3.7, nREPL 0.2.12
Clojure 1.9.0
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_121-b13
    Docs: (doc function-name-here)
          (find-doc "part-of-name-here")
  Source: (source function-name-here)
 Javadoc: (javadoc java-object-or-class-here)
    Exit: Control+D or (exit) or (quit)

Generation:
===

= transitive sentences =

Antonio sees Antonio
I see myself
women see questions
Antonio sees Antonio
works see Antonia
Antonia sees herself
she sees herself
groups see ways
places see her
Antonia sees Antonia

= reflexive sentences =

women see themselves
Antonia sees Antonia
Antonio sees himself
Antonio sees Antonio
it sees itself
I see myself
Antonia sees herself
he sees himself
Antonia sees Antonia
Antonio sees himself

= 'long' sentences =

the small moneys see the tall words
the tall weeks see the tall facts
the tall word sees a tall question
a tall man sees the small businesses
a tall name sees the small governments
the small week sees the tall work
the tall puppies see the tall jobs
the tall governments see a small money
the small cases see the small works
the small rooms see the tall book

Parsing:
===

[np  .the *groups]
[np  .the *stories]
[np  .a *thing]
[s  .days *sleep]
[s  .books *sleep]
[s  .studies *see]
[np  .the *life]
[np  .a *mother]
